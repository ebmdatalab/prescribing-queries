# Prescribing queries

Documentation about common queries against the prescribing dataset.

## Using bigquery

You will need a google account with the correct permissions (set up by an administrator) to access our BigQuery account.

Then follow [this quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/quickstart-web-ui) (ignoring the first section "Before you begin")

### Legacy vs Standard

BigQuery provides a SQL-like interface to massive datasets.  It has two flavours, "legacy" and "standard". When running a query, the default is "legacy"; you must select "standard" in the options section to use that.  Nearly all the examples here are in "standard" format, which is compatible with standard SQL. However, sometimes it is necessary to use "legacy" format as some functions have not yet been ported by Google to the newer format.

* [Standard SQL documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/)
* [Legacy SQL documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/legacy-sql)

Standard SQL supports [temp tables](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#with_query_name) which can make your queries more readable than using lots of subqueries.

The main advantage of Legacy SQL is its more extensive range of [aggregate functions](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/legacy-sql#functions), and in particular, [window functions](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/legacy-sql#syntax-window-functions).  However, it is something of a moving target with new functions being added to Standard SQL all the time.

### Billing

BigQuery is billed by the amount of data queried. Querying the entire prescribing table costs about 20 cents. You should bear these costs in mind if running large numbers of queries. Good practice is to extract, say, one month of data to a new table to design your queries, e.g. running

```sql
SELECT *
FROM ebmdatalab.hscic.prescribing
WHERE month = TIMESTAMP('2016-06-01')
```
...and selecting "save to table". If you then save this to a table `ebmdatalab.tmp.<something>`, then you can continue to design your query like:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM ebmdatalab.tmp.<something>
WHERE bnf_code LIKE '02%'
LIMIT 1000
```

### Overview of datasets in bigquery

* `hscic:prescribing`: the main prescribing dataset. Updated monthly. Data going back to Aug 2010.
* `hscic:practices`: all the practices in England. Updated monthly. Contains latest month's data only (but includes closed practices). Practices with a `setting` of `4` are standard GP practices (see below for a full list of `setting`s). 
* `hscic:practice_statistics`: total list size, and list sizes stratified by gender and age group for each practice. Updated monthly. Contains latest month's data only. Also contains calculated population weightings related to prescribing (STAR-PU and ASTRO-PU), refer to [guidance](http://www.hscic.gov.uk/prescribing/measures) and [code](openprescribing/openprescribing/frontend/model_prescribing_units.py).
* `hscic:presentation`: Average Daily Quantities (ADQs) and related data for each BNF code. Currently updated manually as needed.
* `hscic:tariff`: The Tariff categories (`A`, `C`, or `M`) for each drug that is in Part VIIIa of the Drug Tariff. NP8 (non-Part VIIIa) drugs are omitted from the list. Currently updated manually, from September (this can be backfilled when we need it). Currently contains latest month's data only.
* For more detail on the data sources, refer to [this](openprescribing-data/manifest.json).

## Practice settings

The different kinds of practice available in the `setting` column of the `practices` table are as follows:

* 0 = Other
* 1 = WIC Practice
* 2 = OOH Practice
* 3 = WIC + OOH Practice
* 4 = GP Practice
* 8 = Public Health Service
* 9 = Community Health Service
* 10 = Hospital Service
* 11 = Optometry Service
* 12 = Urgent & Emergency Care
* 13 = Hospice
* 14 = Care Home / Nursing Home
* 15 = Border Force
* 16 = Young Offender Institution
* 17 = Secure Training Centre
* 18 = Secure Children's Home
* 19 = Immigration Removal Centre
* 20 = Court
* 21 = Police Custody
* 22 = Sexual Assault Referral Centre (SARC)
* 24 = Other

## The prescribing table and BNF Codes

The datain the prescribing table covers prescriptions prescribed by
GPs and other non-medical prescribers (nurses, pharmacists and others)
in England and dispensed in the community in the UK. Prescriptions
written in England but dispensed outside England are included.

The format of the data in the prescribing table is documented by the NHS [here](http://content.digital.nhs.uk/media/10686/Download-glossary-of-terms-for-GP-prescribing---presentation-level/pdf/PLP_Presentation_Level_Glossary_April_2015.pdf).

The unique identifier for the item prescribed is the `bnf_code`.

The BNF (British National Formulary) is the de facto standard list of
medicines used UK prescribing. Maintained by the British Medical
Association and the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, it lists
indications, dosages, side effects and so on for more than 70,000
medicines.

The prescribing data uses a modified version of the BNF  which was current in 2014, with custom additions and alterations. The resulting system is called a BNF pseudo-classification and is  described [here](http://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/PrescriptionServices/3197.aspx). In particular, appliances are not listed in the BNF at all, so are included in the pseudo-classification with sections named `DUMMY SECTION`.

The first characters of the code provide a hierarchical classification of the presentation.

The last few characters identify individual presentations, and a way
of identifying their generic equivalents.

The image below shows how you might examine Tramadol. Tramadol is an
opiod pain medicine, available in the UK as tablets (i.e. pills),
capsules (i.e. gelatine things), patches, liquids and more.  Just
focussing on tablets, these are available as standard tablets, and
modified release tablets (which are absorbed by the body over a longer
period of time, allowing the patient to take less frequent doses).
Modified release tablets are available in 50mg, 100mg, 150mg, 200mg,
300mg and 400mg pills.
